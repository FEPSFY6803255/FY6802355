      <p>
        The world is changing so rapidly in the 150 years as human leap into the future at a pace that is not without its consequences. In order to keep up with this expansion new safe energy streams are needed. A promising new advancement in the manipulation of certain properties in some materials was discovered in the 19th century. It is slowly making it into our roads and even our clothes. As we continue to grow, we will find new power sources to keep up with humanity and the can be built in large amounts.

      <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
           As the times change the reliance on electrical energy is exponentially increasing to have 24-hour power in our homes and industries. This has led our main sources of energy to continue to be depleted at a rate which they cannot be reproduced at, forcing us to investigate alternative renewable power. As we pivot to find sustainable sources of energy, we have begun to look at ourselves. We have started to look at how our everyday activities have can at least generate a little bit of power for us to at least power small devices. As the greater population moves into more urbanised locations as time has gone on this has created a lot of foot traffic in condensed area causing a buildup of mechanical energy. This wasted energy can be turned into electrical charge with the use of the piezoelectric effect. "

        "The piezoelectric effect is the ability certain materials possess to generate an electrical charge due to mechanical stress being applied" (Nanomotion Technology, n.d.). "This phenomenon was discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in 1880. They put a crystal quartz under pressure and found it caused an electric charge to be formed from the quartz to other materials "(Uchino, 2017)" . Along with crystals, other piezoelectric materials include ceramics, polymers, cellulose fibres and other synthetic materials. It has changed how we power everyday electronics such as phones, laptops and LEDs."

          "Harnessing small vibrations into electrical energy was proposed in 1996 by 2 electrical engineers "(Williams and Yates, 1996)". Since then, there has been multiple was of trying to integrate it into pavements. This theory has gone as far as to be tested by the California State Government "(Hill, D., Agarwal, A. and Tong, N., 2014)" with many other scientists trying their own variation of using the vibration in the pavements to generate electrical energy. After all the testing the most viable option seems to be using a piezoelectric composite material (meaning piezoelectric materials are mixed with pavement) to make the pavement as it has stronger material integrity and easy laying of the materials. However, this leads to issues such as the material being complex to make, low power output and not producing a continuous stream of energy to be used in applications "(Wang et al., 2018)". While all the evolution this idea has gone since 1996 is great, for it to be used in our daily lives is a long way away from the current day. Work on these pavements will continue into the future as the energy crises grows for years to come.

          "Another application of energy harvesting using the piezoelectric effect is using it in the soles of shoes. This makes use of the mechanical stress applied to the soles as you walk or run creates an ideal situation for the energy generation. Power output of the shoes so far seem to be its biggest weakness as it struggles to even charge a battery to a point of turning an LED on. An average power output of the soles of the shoes with 8 layers was 9mW per shoe at a walking speed of 5.6km/h "(Zhao et al., 2023)". The smaller area and volume the soles of the shoes provide makes piezoelectricity harvesting the most viable choice compared to other forms of energy harvesting due to it only needing a small area for it to take place. It also highly efficient compared to other forms of energy harvesting, however this comes at the cost of some the materials required to make it fragile" (Zhao et al., 2023).

      <p>
           "In recent years the push into the piezoelectric field has exponentially increased as humanity tries to find ways to reuse the available energy presented to us. Many forms of utilising the piezoelectric properties within certain materials such as integrating it into polymers or even piezoelectric films. The power output generated is very volatile as it depends on multiple factors, both internal and external" (Mahapatra et al., 2021)." There are many theoretical ways to solve the problem however, all of these seem to still be in a development stage as they are no practical and create problems of their own. According to "Izadgoshasb (2021)," if humans find a way to harness a for of piezoelectricity in a stable and sustainable way it would allow us to create smart cities in the future, further pushing the human race’s development."
      </p>
   <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
         "As shown in this article, the push for new ways to innovate energy generation is growing year by year. As our current main sources of energy continue to deplete at a rate faster than they can regenerate due to the expansion of cities and access to power to areas without it, new energy plans such as the UK government having net zero emissions by 2050 "(Powering up Britain - The Net Zero Growth Plan, 2023)." While there are many ways to make sustainable energy, piezoelectricity is the most promising to be in the homes of the common people in the future."
