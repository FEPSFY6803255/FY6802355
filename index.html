      As the times change the reliance on electrical energy is exponentially increasing to have 24-hour power in our homes and industries. This has led our main sources of energy to continue to be depleted at a rate which they cannot be reproduced at, forcing us to investigate alternative renewable power. As we pivot to find sustainable sources of energy, we have begun to look at ourselves. We have started to look at how our everyday activities have can at least generate a little bit of power for us to at least power small devices. As the greater population moves into more urbanised locations as time has gone on this has created a lot of foot traffic in condensed area causing a buildup of mechanical energy. This wasted energy can be turned into electrical charge with the use of the piezoelectric effect.
